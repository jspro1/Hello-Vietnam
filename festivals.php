            <h3>🎊 Tết Nguyên Đán (Vietnamese New Year)</h3>
            <p>The most important festival in Vietnamese culture, Tết marks the arrival of spring and the lunar new year. Families often reunite, homes are decorated with peach blossoms and kumquat trees, and traditional foods like bánh chưng are prepared. It is a time for honoring ancestors, giving lucky money in red envelopes, and beginning anew. While fireworks are part of traditional Tết celebrations in some areas, their public use is regulated in many places today, and local community displays are common.</p>

            <h3>🏮 Hoi An Lantern Festival</h3>
            <p>On each full moon night the ancient town of Hoi An transforms into a gentle wonderland: many shops switch off electric lights so thousands of lanterns (some electric, some candle-lit for specific floating lantern events) create a soft glow as people release small lanterns on the Thu Bồn River and make wishes. The event is widely enjoyed by both locals and visitors.</p>
